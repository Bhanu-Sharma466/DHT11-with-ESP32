# DHT11-with-ESP32
here we will know that how to connect the esp32 with the dht11 sensor through arduino Iot cloud


Components Needed:
ESP32 development board
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Step 1: Setup the Hardware
Connect the DHT11 Sensor to the ESP32:
Connect the VCC pin of the DHT11 to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
Connect the GND pin of the DHT11 to a GND pin on the ESP32.
Connect the DATA pin of the DHT11 to a digital GPIO pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 4).
Step 2: Setup Arduino IDE for ESP32
Install the ESP32 Board Package:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Preferences.
In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add the URL for the ESP32 board package.
Go to Tools > Board > Board Manager, search for "ESP32", and install the package.
Install Required Libraries:

Install the following libraries using the Library Manager in Arduino IDE:
DHT sensor library
Adafruit Unified Sensor library
ArduinoIoTCloud library
WiFi library (if not already installed)
Step 3: Setup Arduino Cloud IoT
Create an Account on Arduino Cloud IoT:

Go to the Arduino Cloud IoT platform and sign up for an account.
Create a Thing:

In the Arduino Cloud IoT dashboard, create a new Thing.
Name your Thing and add variables for temperature and humidity. Set the appropriate data types (e.g., float) for these variables.
Configure the Device:

Add your ESP32 as a device in the Thing configuration.
Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a Device ID and Secret Key.
Link the device to your Thing.
Step 4: Configure the Sketch
Prepare the Sketch:
The Arduino Cloud IoT platform will generate a thingProperties.h file that includes the necessary credentials and variable definitions.
Write a sketch in the Arduino IDE that includes:
Initialization of the DHT11 sensor.
Reading temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor.
Sending the data to the Arduino Cloud IoT platform using the ArduinoIoTCloud library.
Step 5: Upload and Monitor Data
Upload the Sketch to ESP32:

Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to the ESP32.
Monitor Real-Time Data:

Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to verify the data being read from the DHT11 sensor.
Go to the Arduino Cloud IoT dashboard to see real-time temperature and humidity data being updated from your ESP32.
By following these steps, you will successfully connect your ESP32 with a DHT11 sensor and send real-time data to the Arduino Cloud IoT platform.
